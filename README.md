# hello_project
this is my first project as an individual
I have used git earlier for my university project. To be honest at that time I could not focus much on learning this tool as I have to complete a number of things at the same time. Now is the perfect time to learn it in details.
Here I will write the simple hello project that will display hello world.
As I am learning regarding the git, I am trying to make some tweaks to see if they work or not. This is the first branch that I have created. Thank you.
